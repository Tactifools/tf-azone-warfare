## Briefing

### Situation

Welcome to Tanoa, a lush yet treacherous island now gripped by chaos. The FIA (Freedom and Independence Army), a violent terrorist organization, has overthrown the local government and plunged the region into anarchy. As operatives of the Tactifools PMC, you have been contracted to restore order, dismantle FIA control, and pave the way for the reestablishment of a lawful government. 
 
This is not a conventional war—expect guerilla tactics, ambushes, and a hostile populace. Your operations will require precision, teamwork, and resourcefulness. Every bullet counts, and survival hinges on your ability to adapt, outmaneuver, and outsmart the enemy.

### Mission

**Primary Objectives:**   

1. **Secure and Liberate Key Locations:**   
   Reclaim strategic areas on Tanoa (villages, infrastructure, and compounds) from FIA control. Maintain a foothold in these areas to stabilize them.   
 
2. **Disrupt FIA Operations:**   
   Identify and neutralize FIA commanders, supply caches, and communication hubs to destabilize their network and reduce their operational capabilities.   
 
**Secondary Objectives:**

1. **Resource Management:**   
   Scavenge weapons, ammunition, and equipment from fallen enemies or as mission rewards to sustain operations. Resupply options are extremely limited, and prioritization of resources is crucial.   
 
2. **Expand Operational Reach:**   
   Discover and establish additional landing zones (LZs) as you move deeper into enemy territory. These LZs will serve as vital points for resupply, reinforcements, and medevac. 

### Execution

**Rules of Engagement (ROE):**   
- Avoid unnecessary civilian casualties — hearts and minds are a priority.   
- Do not engage targets unless positively identified as hostile.   
- Pilots are restricted to operating only at **pre-designated LZs** for insertions and extractions. Additional LZs may be cleared during the operation.
